N2 - approximate **N**\ earest **N**\ eighbor

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from n2 import HnswIndex

    N, dim = 10240, 20
    samples = np.arange(N * dim).reshape(N, dim)

    index = HnswIndex(dim)
    for sample in samples:
        index.add_data(sample)
    index.build(m=5, n_threads=4)
    print(index.search_by_id(0, 10))
    # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Install
-------

To install:

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install n2

For more detail, see `the installation`_ for instruction on how to build N2 from source.

Introduce
---------

N2 is an approximate nearest neighborhoods algorithm library written in
C++ (including Python/Go bindings). N2 provides a much faster search
speed than other implementations when modeling large dataset. Also, N2
supports multi-core CPUs for index building.

Background
----------

There are great approximate nearest neighborhoods libraries such as
`annoy`_ and `nmslib`_, but they did not fully meet the requirments to
handle Kakao’s dataset. Therefore, we decided to implement a library
that improves usability and performs better based on `nmslib`_. And
finally, we release N2 to the world.

Features
--------

-  Efficient implementations. N2 run faster and lightweights, especially
   for large dataset.
-  Support multi-core CPUs for index building.
-  Support a mmap feature by default for handling large index files
   efficiently.
-  Support Python/Go bindings.

Performance
-----------

If you want to read about detail benchmark explanation. See `the
benchmark`_ for more experiments.
